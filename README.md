## Previous Work

Inspired by the game ['Machine Learning and Cats'](http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/cat-computer-program-drawing?utm_source=facebook.com&utm_medium=atlas-page) provided by Prof. Goldman, we were tring to figure out the mechanism behind it.

After a lot of research, we finally found this is based on an algorithm for combining the content of one image with the style of another image using convolutional neural networks.

Here is the related paper we found:
